# ADR 0047: Logging Behavior

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Logging is essential for monitoring application activity and diagnosing issues. A dedicated behavior is introduced to log details of incoming requests and outgoing responses.

## Decision

We will use **LoggingBehavior** to:

- Log incoming requests and outgoing responses.
- Provide visibility into the application's operations.
- Enable traceability for debugging and monitoring.

## Consequences

- **Pros**:
  - Improves observability of application behavior.
  - Centralized logging for requests and responses.

- **Cons**:
  - Potential performance overhead due to logging.

## Implementation

This behavior will be registered in the application's dependency injection container and executed as part of the Mediator pipeline.
