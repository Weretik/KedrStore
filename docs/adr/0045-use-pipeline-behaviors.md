# ADR 0045: Use Pipeline Behaviors for Request Handling

## Status
Accepted

## Context

In the application layer, Mediator patterns are used to handle requests and responses. To enhance the functionality and maintainability of the request handling process, pipeline behaviors are introduced. These behaviors allow for cross-cutting concerns to be handled in a centralized and reusable manner.

## Decision

We will use the following pipeline behaviors:

1. **UnhandledExceptionBehavior**: Captures and handles unhandled exceptions during request processing, ensuring that the application remains stable and logs critical errors.

2. **LoggingBehavior**: Logs the details of incoming requests and outgoing responses, providing visibility into the application's operations.

3. **ValidationBehavior**: Validates incoming requests using FluentValidation to ensure data integrity and correctness before processing.

4. **ExceptionHandlingBehavior**: Handles application-specific exceptions (`AppException`) and maps them to appropriate response types, such as `AppResult` or `AppResult<T>`.

## Consequences

- **Pros**:
  - Centralized handling of cross-cutting concerns.
  - Improved maintainability and readability of request handling logic.
  - Enhanced error handling and logging capabilities.
  - Ensures data validation before processing requests.

- **Cons**:
  - Slight increase in complexity due to the introduction of multiple behaviors.
  - Potential performance overhead if behaviors are not optimized.

## Implementation

These behaviors will be registered in the application's dependency injection container and executed in the order defined by Mediator. Each behavior will focus on its specific concern, ensuring separation of responsibilities.
