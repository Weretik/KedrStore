# ADR 0001: Use Clean Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-05-25

## Context
At the start of the KedrStore project, it was necessary to choose an architectural approach that ensures:

- Long-term maintainability of the codebase
- Decoupling of business logic from frameworks and tools
- Easy and independent testing of components
- Flexibility for future changes in requirements
- Clear separation of concerns between application layers

## Decision
We have decided to adopt **Clean Architecture**, as proposed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). This approach is based on the following core principles:

1. **Framework Independence**: The architecture does not rely on any particular library or framework.
2. **Testability**: Business rules can be tested in isolation from the UI, database, or any external infrastructure.
3. **UI Independence**: The user interface can be replaced without affecting the core system.
4. **Database Independence**: The system does not depend on a specific database implementation.
5. **External Service Independence**: The system's core does not know about external services.

The architecture is organized into the following layers:

- **Entities**: Core business objects
- **Use Cases**: Application-specific business rules
- **Interface Adapters**: Convert and adapt data between layers
- **Frameworks & Drivers**: External tools, frameworks, and delivery mechanisms

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of responsibilities across components
- Business logic is independently testable and reusable
- Easier long-term maintenance and refactoring
- Reduced risk of breaking core logic due to technology stack changes
- Easier migration to new frameworks over time

### Negative
- Higher initial development complexity
- Additional code required for data transformation between layers
- May be considered over-engineered for simple projects
- Requires onboarding and understanding of Clean Architecture principles

## Implementation

1. The solution structure is organized as follows:
    - `KedrStore.Domain`: Entities and core business logic
    - `KedrStore.Application`: Use cases and business rules
    - `KedrStore.Infrastructure`: Data access, third-party integrations
    - `KedrStore.Presentation`: User interface (Blazor Web App)

2. Dependencies flow inward — only outer layers depend on inner ones.

3. Communication between layers is handled via DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).

4. Dependency inversion is implemented using interfaces and a DI container.

5. The CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern is implemented in the Application layer:
   - Commands represent intentions to change the system state
   - Queries represent requests for data without state changes
   - Each command and query has a dedicated handler
   - Clear separation of read and write operations improves maintainability
